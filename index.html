                                  I believe in-depth user research provides the essential guidelines for every meaningful user experience. Using diverse qualitative and quantitative research techniques, I deeply empathize with my users and focus on understanding their behaviour, needs and motivations.

                                 Valuable user experience is key to success in today's business. I am skilled at solving design problems by ideating and generating complex user-centered design concepts. As a designer I am responsible for the visual appearance of concepts by creating storyboards, user journey maps, wireframes and maintain a design system of UI components.

                            <p> Getting feedback and experimenting with an early sample of an interactive design concept is important and benefitial for the success of every product. I create high-fidelity experiential prototypes and test how users interact with different design concepts, which helps making better informed design decisions.

                            <p> Great products are developed in multidisciplinary teams who apply a deliberate nexus between business strategy and design thinking to solve problems. I identify strategic target groups and create design visions. I am an analytical active listener with strategic thinking, skilled at communicating with stakeholders.

                            <h2>Energy Based Working</h2>

                            <p> Energy Based Working (EBW) is a service design project for the Dutch Architecture Bureau Heembouw. The huge company office space needed a new sustainable design, stimulating activity based working which resulted in this challenging project objective: “Stimulate the employees of Heembouw to use the available variety in work spaces in such a way that it supports the well being of the employees while having a positive environmental impact.”</p>       
                            
                            <p> The EBW concept solves the complex design challenge through interactive gamification. The concept has a clean, simple and very engaging UX design, motivating its users to reach higher levels of sustainable office environment. The game blends easily into the everyday-life of employees by using familiar elements like budget and presents energy usage in a more tangible way by expressing consumption in CO2 points. It provides real-time feedback to increase awareness about energy usage and personal well-being. EBW engages its users by applying the principles of quantified self which make it fun, social and competitive.
                            </p> 

                            <p> The interactive EBW game will be part of the everyday worklife at the office. By using a personal EBW card every employee will check in at his workspot in a special card reader. Only after check-in the energy sources and devices in a room such as sockets, AC, lights or monitors will become available. Every user will be charged with CO2 points per minute for the period of working. At group meetings the energy consumption will be divided among the participants which encourages office space sharing. The Work Cafe at the Heembouw office is a point free zone where everyone can relax and get a break from the competition. Keeping better personal energy levels will be enabled by a special timer. Its purpose is to increase attention span among employees by making them set their own goals for a peroid of focused and uninterrupted working time. Following these goals along with every recycling attemp in the office  will be rewarded with extra CO2 points.
                            </p>  

                           <p> Game statistics will be available on a personal dashboard. The dashboard will be part of an interactive system implemented in<br>the already existing Heembouw platform. Every employee will be provided with budget and is alone responsible and personally in charge for his CO2 points consumption. After every week employees will end up having an amount of points which will be transferred (positive or negative) to their savings account. Leaderboard will show real-time performance of every employee<br> in the ranklist based on their current budget points. At the end of every week the best players in the game will benefit by receiving different rewards from the company.</p>


                           <p>The Energy Based Working service design concept is brought to<br>life with a video prototype that presents the user flow and his interaction with all the touchpoints of the system.</p>

                        <p style="font-style:italic;">Design and create a business website for a holistic care center that increases awareness on the topic holistic care and promotes the business service in a simple, concise and uncontroversial manner.</p>

                            <p> Vitality Center is a project for design and development of the official website of the "Vitality" Center for Holistic Care in Burgas, Bulgaria. 


                           <p> Although holistic care services and professionals are getting more and more popular in Bulgaria in recent years, there is still a bit of controversy and unclarity about their true nature and application. This is why it was very important for me to clearly present the center's professionals and their services to the public.


                            <p> For the design I decided on using fresh and natural colors to provoke a welcoming, friendly and thrustworhy feeling among the online audience. The lenght of textual descriptions is reduced to minimum and there is emphasis on colorful visuals. The holistic topic and nature of the business is extra communicated via blog section with weekly articles.

                            <h2>Inspectory</h2>

                            <p> Smart Society is a mega-trend in our modern world. It successfully harnesses the potential of digital technology, connected devices and the use of digital networks to improve people’s lives. Being led by the strong spirit of innovation the Dutch municipality of Delft is investing in student-driven projects to modernize its administrative services. The high-quality maintanence of public spaces has always been a difficult task, but smart technologies are now having the potential to change that.</p>
 

                           <p> Looking for innovative ideas and opportunities, the municipality of Delft assigned me and my fellow students with an interesting challenge:<br>Design a smart tool that manages and distributes work in public spaces in a simple and accessible way! This is how the project "Inspectory" was born.</p>


                           <p> "Inspectory" is a mobile design project aiming at supporting public space management inspectors in their daily tasks. Currently inspectors are having an old-established work flow. They get alerted from citizens about public space issues. Every signal they receive have to be inspected personally. Then inspectors have to return to the municipality, write a report about the problem and assign the right maintanence comapany with the task to solve it. This is a long procedure that requires quite a lot of effort. Gemeente Delft has recently invested in tablet devices that should digitalyze the administrative process, but still needs a special mobile application. It should enable inspectors to write reports and assign tasks to maintanence contractors on the spot, saving a lot of time and effort.</p>

                            <p> Designing for administrative processes is quite difficult taking into account the many diverse and often unclear requirements. However the current design of the Inspectory mobile application gets a lot of positive feedback from the client and its future potential users.</p>
                            

                            <p> Main design requirement for the mobile application is the presence of a clear and exact map of the city, navigating inspectors to different locations. The map is a key design element. It must present different public space problems with pinpoints and signalize the exact stage of their work progress. In addition to that, inspectors must be provided with an easy reporting system. Having a categorized overview of all the different current problems is another important requirement for the app.</p>


                            <p> The current UI of the app succeeds in meeting those requirements. Recent usability tests revealed that inspectors are interacting with the system very naturally. They gave positive feedback about the information architecture and the aestetics. They believe Inspectory is exactly what they need and cant wait to start using it.</p>


                            <p> Inspectory is a unique project, because it translates the unpleasent administrative job into a desired and valuable digital user experience!</p>

                        <p style="font-style:italic;">Design a mutual fund investment platform with focus on usabillity and accessibility, including a robo-advisory service that stimulates investments and minimizes risk.</p>

                            <p> Monett is an ambitious Romanian Fintech start-up for distribution of mutual funds. It is aiming at creating a sophisticated personal wealth management digital service.  

                            <p> The start-up is a collaboration between the Bulgarian software development companany "BG Web Soft Ltd." and the Romanian investment intermediary "Goldring SSIF". The product will be launched for the Romanian financial market.  </p>

                            <p> As Monett's product designer, my main goal was to make the product useful, usable, efficient and aesthetically pleasing. It's design should self-navigate and assist the user on every single step of his digital interaction with the app. For this project I was additionally assigned with some project management related tasks such as planning and prioritizing work and communicating with stakeholders.</p>

                            <p> Monett is basically a mutual fund trading platform and as such it is essential for the application to present the performance of the user's investments in a digital portfolio and offer a marketplace for all the distributed mutual funds. There is also detailed information about the benefits and risks of every possible investment.
                            </p>
                            <p> Users can make single direct investments in mutual funds or start their own investment plans with monthly installments according to their preference.</p>
                            <p> There are various investment tools available for the user to simulate investment and compare different mutual funds and their performance and expected profits. Pension calculators and financial health status evaluator is also part of the app's features.     
                            </p>
                            <p> In order for Monett to be the best product of its kind on the market, it is going to offer a sophisticated robo advisor. It will help users make the best investment decisions according to their pre-measured investment profile. The robo advisor will prevent users from making risky investments and help them maximize their profits.</p>
                            <p> Monett is about money, not art! It is about increasing personal wealth!</p>

                        <p> I worked on a project for redesign of the Postbank Mobile Banking Application. Based on my research and design concept my employer started negotiating on developing the bank's new mobile app.  

                       <p> I conducted an in-depth user research to identify the problems of the current design. The outcome was that Postbank mobile app users are in general satisfied with their mobile banking experience. The results of my research showed that users are experiencing some difficulties with the visual appearance of the way their bank accounts are linked to their cards. The procedure for ordering a money transfer between accounts was defined as unnecessary complicated, especially the transfers between own accounts. An interesting finding was the missing option for easily requesting a payment from another user.</p>

                        <p> After carefully analyzing my research findings I created a design concept with focus on the user and his needs.</p>

                        <p> The redesinged mobile banking app is essentially based on the existing application. It includes many new features such as virtual cards, NFC payments option, payment request generator with QR code and also access to the bank's investment services.

                        <h2>Paysafe Payment Gateway</h2>
                        <h5>Overview</h5>
                        <p >The payment gateway is a major revenue stream for Paysafe. It is operating in many countries around the world and facing millions of users. As a designer responsible for the product. I have put long hours into developing and maintaining a seamless and efficient payment experience. I have been involved in many gateway initiatives and projects ranging from a general redesign to integrating a crypto payment option and major KYC flow changes. </p>
                        <h5>Design challenge</h5>
                        <p>It is rather difficult to generalize and point out one major design challenge for the payment gateway, but it would be fair to say that creating an easy secure and efficient payment experience with special focus on sport betting and gambling has always been a leading goal for every project initiative.</p>
                        <h5>Target users</h5>
                        <p> Same as for the design challenge, the target user for the payment gateway could not be generalized. There are many different persona types, but the most important one for the product driving most of the revenue has always been the sport bettor and gambler. Usually these are young 20 - 40 yo users who are sport fans and bet between 2–5 times a week. Their main needs are having secure payment options with high limits and minimizing the time & cost it takes to deposit & withdraw funds to/from betting operators, 
                        </p>
                        <h5>Role and collaboration</h5>
                        <p>I am the only designer in the company merchant stream and have worked with many dev, product and marketing teams and a big amount of internal and external stakeholders. Most of the time I usually work with 3 dev teams of around 4 members, but for some bigger initiatives I have been the go-to designer for up to 6 dev teams.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Major initiatives</h5>
                        <h6>Gateway redesign</h6>
                        <p>One of the major projects that I have worked on is the redesign of the payment gateway. The old gateway design did a good service, but it was already too old and needed a fresh rework if we wanted to attract more users and perform better in the time to task on task and task success rate metrics. For the redesign I focused on optimizing the dashboard with the available payment methods. They needed to be presented in a clear and self-explanatory way to the user, minimizing the friction and number of click to completing a payment. For the new design I had to stick to the existing design system components except for a couple of area special components. The redesigned Gateway was successfully launched first for the US market and then for the rest of the world.</p>
                        <h6>Crypto payment</h6>
                        <p>Having a new payment option on a worldwide used gateway is not a big deal, but when it is one of the first available crypto payment options out there it could be called an achievement. I am proud to say that I worked on special user flow that enables Skrill users to pay with their wallet available crypto balance. 
                        <h6>FastLane payment</h6>
                        <p>Aiming for having the fastest payment experience I worked on a FastLane option flow enabling users to save preferred payment options for more convenient future use. </p>
                        <h6>US iGaming</h6>
                        <p>The US iGaming gateway initiative has always been a major one for me since Skrill is massively entering the US gambling market in the past year and a half. In order to rapidly increase our user base and deliver a more desired experience for our US users, me and my fellow colleagues created a special one-of-a-kind flow that requires no KYC during registration and enables payments of up to 1000 USD without additional verification. In addition to that we developed a special VIP club program that enables us to attract the top gamblers out there. </p>

                        <h5>Design challenge</h5>
                        <p style="font-style:italic;">Design a simple and accessible trading platform with focus on novice users, stimulating as many investment operations as possible. </p>
                        
                        <p> I am currently working on a project for design of a desktop trading platform for Raiffeisen Bank Bulgaria. The product is intended to provide the bank clients with an access to the financial markets around the world. 

                        <p> Financial trading is getting more and more popular every year among greater audience of non-proffessional investors. This is why Raifeissen Bank Bulgaria wants to offer its clients a new simple, accesible and less detailed investment service that is focused more on the novice users. The Desktop Trading Platform will be powered by the software product "Finasyst" of the Bulgarian company "BG Web Soft Ltd."  </p>

                        <p> Users will be given the opportunity to trade stocks, etfs, gold and forex. The investment details related to technical and financial data and analysises are limited to the legaly allowed minimum. This makes the app appear more simple, accesible and desirable. The design is emphasizing on the most trendy and popular stocks from the american market.
                        <p> The platform provides easy access to "Buy" and "Sell" order requests from almost every screen. This design decision is taken with the intent to stimulate more order requests. Novice users usually tend to make impulsive and emotional investment decisions and by lowering the commision fees, but icreasing the amount of investments the bank is planning to drive revenue.     

                        <p> This project is in early stages of negotiations with Raiffeisenbank, but the concept already received positive and valuable feedback.

                        <p >The Sports Corner is the newest and most significant features of the Skrill wallet. It gives various sport related winning tips, head-to-head statistics, live score, player and the latest news. It is an important project that would help Skrill on his way towards the ultimate goal to become the best e-wallet for gambling worldwide. The launch of the sport corner and its positive feedback gave birth to project for a new wallet app onboarding and a personalized dashboard for sport bettors. The new redesigned Skrill MVP version is going to be launched and tested on the Portuguese market. </p>
                        <h5>Design challenge</h5>
                        <p>Create a new personalized wallet dashboard design for sports bettors worldwide that enables them to have a better and more desired overall payment and betting experience and conveniently manage their personal finances.</p>
                        <h5>Target users</h5>
                        <p> The target persona for this project is the so-called Sport ritualist. This is a young 20 - 40 y.o. male who is a huge sport fan and bet between 2 – 5 times a week. His main goals are to make informed and well-thought bets, have control over his betting funds and feel informed about what is happening in the football domain. His needs are to minimize the time & cost it takes to deposit & withdraw funds to/from betting operators, decrease the time to learn the most important facts & developments about football and minimize the time it takes to gather the necessary statistics for selected games 
                        </p>

                        <h5>Work process</h5>
                        <h6>Research & Define</h6>
                        <p>We did desk research and a series of interviews to come up with user archetypes and get to know who we are designing for in tiny details. We also worked on investigating our competitors and analyzed their product and digital experiences.</p>
                        <p>Based on our research findings we created empathy and journey maps that helped us formulate exact job statements and HMW questions.
                        <h6>Ideate, Prototype & Test</h6>
                        <p>We then ideated on different low & high-fidelity concepts and UI elements and tested them with users to gather important feedback and iterated until we have a good design solution. </p>
                        <h5>Outcome</h5>
                        <p>TWe created a new Skrill onboarding experience that gathers important data about the personal preferences of the user regarding sports and the financial services that we offer. After a successful registration the user lands on a personalized dashboard with emphasis on upcoming games and statistics. There is information on where and how he can spend with Skrill and what additional financial services we can offer. The user is also provided with additional navigation and explanation of the remaining required steps for him until he is fully onboarded. During this initiative I also explored additional concepts for services that could add value and drive extra revenue such as Sports travelling offers. </p>

                        <h5>Design challenge</h5>
                        <p style="font-style:italic;">Design a mobile app for paying in city parking zones via SMS and cards with focus on desirability and ease of use.</p>
                        <p> In the summer of 2020 I was assigned with a project for design of a new mobile app for parking payments in big Bulgarian cities. 
                        <p> Parking SMS is my design concept for an app that allows you to pay public parking easily with features like detecting your location and sending the appropriate short text message (SMS) to the corresponding service numbers. Payments are also possible via bank cards.
                        <p> You can create a profile for each one of your cars and send parking messages with a single tap. Additionally, you can share your parking payments requests via social media and send parking messages for other people. 
                        <p> Available parking zones are suggested automatically, based on your location. Parking position is detected and displayed on the map in the application along with the nearby parking zone bounds.
                        <p> Parking SMS is a fresh and easy to use app that makes your city parking issues way less complicated.
